About
======
I am a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering studying Non-Linear Dynamics, Mechanical Metamaterials, and Computational Mathematics at the University of Maryland, College Park.
My research interests include non-linear dynamics, mechanical metamaterials, and computational methods.

Before arriving at College Park in 2022, I studied applied math at DePaul University (2020-2022) with a concentration in computational mechanics.
I obtained my bachelor's in mechanical engineering from Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago (2017-2020).
