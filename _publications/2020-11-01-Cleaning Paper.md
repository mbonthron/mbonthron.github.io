Gecko-inspired adhesives are one of the most promising forms of controllable adhesives for a wide range of applications, especially robotic gripping, perching, and climbing. One impediment to the technology's success is the negative effect of dust and other contaminants, which can significantly decrease adhesion in real-world environments. Previous work has shown that electrostatic forces were capable of removing adhered dust on the surface of gecko-inspired adhesives and that a two-phase square wave input to the electrostatic element with the lowest possible frequency produced the highest cleaning efficiency. In this work, dust particle size, electrode geometry (electrode width and gap), duty cycle of the exciting wave, peak-peak voltage of the electrodes, and the thickness of dielectric layer (the gecko-inspired microstructures) are evaluated experimentally and in simulation. Moreover, three possible â€¦
